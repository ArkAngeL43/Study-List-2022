# What is this 

This list is a combined list of topics I am studying this year (2022) all the way up to 2024. This will also include resources of the topics. This can include lists of articles, books etc. I practically have 2 years to finish this entire list and become intermediate to advanced in all fields and topics. Simply because when 2024 hits I will be signing those papers at a USMC office :)

# List of topics 

| Topic | Reason | 
| ----- | ------ |
| Medical | Backup |
| Electrical Engineering | because I am too good for computers built by major companies even small ones, so I am going to build one on my own |
| Mechanics and automotive industrial systems | Mechanics So I do not have to waste food money on car fixes | 
| CybrerSecurity | Its something im good at why not get better | 
| Programming | Its another thing I am good at so wht not get better | 
| Linear Algebra | Needed for development | 
| Geometry | Needed for development | 
| Trigonometry | Needed for development |
| Cryptography | Why not make my own algorithm |
| Game engines | Why not make my own game engine |
| Exploit development | I want to be a god at this | 
| Search engines | I love algorithms | 
| Reverse Engineering | Sick as ffff |
| Survival | Why not |
| Chemistry | Another why not |
| Java | Because java is- well- special |
| Computer Science | Better my skill in development |
